# **Revision Worksheet: The Ice Cream Factory 🍦**

Theme: Surface Areas, Volumes, and Cost Analysis  
Constants: Use $\\pi \= \\frac{22}{7}$ for all calculations.

### **Phase 1: Production (Waffles & Cones)**

#### **1\. The Dough Requirement**

An industrial mixer contains a specific volume of waffle dough. We need to calculate how much dough is actually used to bake a single cone.

* **The Cone Dimensions:** The baked cone has a **base radius (**$r$**) of 21 mm** and a **vertical height (**$h$**) of 28 mm**.  
* **The Thickness:** The walls of the cone are **1 mm thick**.  
* **Approximation:** Assume the volume of dough \= (Curved Surface Area of the cone) $\\times$ (Thickness).

Question: Calculate the volume of dough (in $mm^3$) required to produce one such cone.  
(Hint: First find the slant height $l$).

#### **2\. The Waffle Basket (Frustum)**

The factory introduces a "Waffle Basket" for sundaes.

* **Shape:** It has a flat circular base and a curved side that flares outwards (a frustum).  
* **Dimensions:**  
  * Bottom (Base) Radius ($r\_1$) \= **21 mm**  
  * Top (Open) Radius ($r\_2$) \= **42 mm**  
  * Vertical Height of the basket ($h$) \= **28 mm**  
* **Note:** The slant height ($l$) here is calculated using the difference in radii ($r\_2 \- r\_1$).

**Question:** Find the Total Surface Area of the basket (Area of the circular base \+ Curved Surface Area of the frustum).

### **Phase 2: Concepts & Applications (Spheres)**

#### **3\. The Formula**

**Statement:** Recall that for a sphere of radius $r$, the Surface Area is $4\\pi r^2$. No calculation required.

#### **4\. Painting the Moon**

A theme park is building a giant scale model of the Moon.

* **Dimension:** The model is a sphere with a **radius of 21 meters**.  
* **The Task:** They want to paint the entire surface with a layer of blue paint that is **1 mm thick**.

Question: How many litres of paint are required?  
(Hint: 1 cubic meter \= 1000 Litres. $1 \\text{ mm} \= 0.001 \\text{ meters}$. Volume of paint $\\approx$ Surface Area $\\times$ Thickness)

#### **5\. Volume of Scoops**

Statement: Let's practice the volume formula.  
Question: Calculate the volume (in $mm^3$) of a perfect sphere of ice cream with a radius of 21 mm.

### **Phase 3: Cost Analysis (The Business End)**

*For the following problems, assume the cone dimensions are different from Phase 1 to allow for bigger servings.*

* **New Cone Dimensions:** Radius ($r$) \= **21 mm**, Height ($h$) \= **90 mm**.

#### **6\. The "Classic" (Scoop on Top)**

We sell an **empty** waffle cone with a spherical scoop sitting on top.

* **Waffle Cost:** ₹5 per cone (fixed).  
* **Ice Cream Cost:** ₹1 per $1000 \\text{ mm}^3$ (per ml).  
* **Configuration:** A single sphere of ice cream (Radius \= **21 mm**) sits on top of the empty cone.

**Question:** What is the total input cost for one "Classic" ice cream?

#### **7\. The "Fully Loaded" (Filled \+ Hemisphere)**

We fill the cone completely with "Vanilla Cream" and top it with a hemisphere of "Premium Ice Cream".

* **Vanilla Cream Cost:** ₹0.50 per $1000 \\text{ mm}^3$.  
* **Premium Ice Cream Cost:** ₹2 per $1000 \\text{ mm}^3$.  
* **Configuration:**  
  * Cone (Radius 21 mm, Height 90 mm) filled with Vanilla Cream.  
  * Hemisphere (Radius 21 mm) of Premium Ice Cream on top.  
  * Waffle Cost: ₹5.

**Question:** Calculate the total cost.

### **Phase 4: Premium Engineering (Composite Solids)**

#### **8\. The "Secret Surprise"**

We are launching a premium cone with three distinct layers inside the cone (Radius 21 mm, Height 90 mm).

1. **Bottom Layer (Dark Chocolate):** The bottom **30 mm** (height) of the cone is filled with solid dark chocolate.  
2. **Middle Layer (Vanilla Cream):** The rest of the cone (the frustum part) is filled with vanilla cream.  
3. **Top Layer (Ice Cream):** A full spherical scoop (Radius 21 mm) sits on top.

**Input Costs:**

* Dark Chocolate: ₹3 per $1000 \\text{ mm}^3$.  
* Vanilla Cream: ₹0.50 per $1000 \\text{ mm}^3$.  
* Ice Cream Sphere: (Use the cost calculated in Q6).  
* Waffle Cost: ₹5.

Question: Find the total cost of this premium product.  
(Hint: Use similar triangles to find the radius of the small chocolate cone at the bottom).

#### **9\. The "Cornetto" Style (Bonus)**

Instead of a sphere on top, this version has a flat chocolate disk.

* **Bottom:** Solid Dark Chocolate cone (Height 30 mm).  
* **Middle:** Vanilla Cream (Frustum).  
* **Top:** A thick circular disk of Dark Chocolate seals the cone.  
  * Disk Radius \= **21 mm**.  
  * Disk Thickness \= **5 mm**.

**Question:** Using the same rates as Q8, what is the cost of this ice cream?
